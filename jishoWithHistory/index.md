# Jisho with History

辞書[jisho] (a dictionary, in Japanese), and also the name of [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/).

The site is wonderful, but the problem is that I'll end up opening dozens of tabs while reading, and then I have to sort through them all later.

The goal is to stop me from open 50+ tabs whenever I read something.
